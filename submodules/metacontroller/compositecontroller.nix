                - InPlace: Immediately update any children that differ from the desired state.
                - RollingRecreate: Delete each child that differs from the desired state, one at a time,
                  and recreate each child before moving on to the next one.
                  Pause the rollout if at any time one of the children that have already been updated fails one or more status checks.
